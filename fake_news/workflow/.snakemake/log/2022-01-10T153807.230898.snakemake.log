MissingOutputException in line 1 of /Users/corrado/_repositories/fake_news_wf/fake_news/workflow/rules/save_fit_ref_model.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
../results/models/td_ref_pol_fit.rds
../results/models/td_ref_pol_pp_check.pdf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
